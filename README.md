# Mastermind

#### A one-player commmand line mastermind game. 
In the game, you can choose to be either a *code-breaker* or a *code-maker*. If you choose to be a code-breaker, the computer randomly generates a unique code which you'll have to break. 
If you choose to be a code-maker, you'll make the code and the computer will try to break it. The computer uses an algorithm that I've created to break your code. So be sure to give it a difficult code to break.
Fret not if you don't understand all this. There are additional instructions that's displayed at the beginning of the game.

#### To run the game, put the following commands on the terminal. 
*Ruby is required to be installed in the computer for the game to run.*
